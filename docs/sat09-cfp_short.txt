SAT 2009 - 12th International Conference on Theory
and Applications of Satisfiability Testing
  Call for Papers
  June 30 - July 3, 2009, Swansea, United Kingdom
  http://cs.swan.ac.uk/~csoliver/SAT2009/index.html
* The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
  Satisfiability Testing is the primary annual meeting for researchers
  studying the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT). SAT'09 is
  the twelfth SAT conference. SAT'09 features the SAT competition, the
  the Pseudo-Boolean evaluation, and the MAX-SAT evaluation.
* The topics of the conference span practical and
  theoretical research on SAT and its applications and include, but are
  not limited to, proof systems, proof complexity, search algorithms,
  heuristics, analysis of algorithms, hard instances, randomized
  formulae, problem encodings, industrial applications, solvers,
  simplifiers, tools, case studies and empirical results. SAT is
  interpreted in a rather broad sense: besides propositional
  satisfiability, it includes the domain of quantified boolean
  formulae (QBF), constraints programming techniques (CSP) for
  word-level problems and their propositional encoding and
  particularly satisfiability modulo theories (SMT).
* Important dates:  Abstract submission due: 20 Feb 2009;
  Paper submission: 27 Feb 2009; Notification: 29 Mar 2009.
