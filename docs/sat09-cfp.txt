	                Call for Papers

	         12th International Conference on
	Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing

  The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
  Satisfiability Testing is the primary annual meeting for researchers
  studying the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT). SAT09 is
  the twelfth SAT conference. SAT09 features the SAT Race, the
  Max-SAT Evaluation, and the QBFEVAL.


SCOPE 

  Many hard combinatorial problems can be encoded into SAT.
  Therefore improvements on heuristics on the practical side, as well 
  as theoretical insights into SAT apply to a large range of real-world
  problems. More specifically, many important practical verification
  problems can be rephrased as SAT problems. This applies to
  verification problems in hardware and software. Thus SAT is becoming
  one of the most important core technologies to verify secure and
  dependable systems. The topics of the conference span practical and
  theoretical research on SAT and its applications and include but are
  not limited to proof systems, proof complexity, search algorithms,
  heuristics, analysis of algorithms, hard instances, randomized
  formulae, problem encodings, industrial applications, solvers,
  simplifiers, tools, case studies and empirical results. SAT is
  interpreted in a rather broad sense: besides propositional
  satisfiability, it includes the domain of quantified boolean
  formulae (QBF), constraints programming techniques (CSP) for
  word-level problems and their propositional encoding and
  particularly satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). 


SUBMISSION

  Submissions should contain original material and can either be
  regular research papers up to 14 pages or short papers up to 6
  pages. Double submissions including submissions as short and long
  papers will be rejected.  Submissions should use the Springer
  LNCS style. All appendices, tables, figures and the bibliography
  must fit into the page limit. Submissions deviating from these
  requirements may be rejected without review. 
  
  All accepted papers including short papers will be published 
  in the proceedings of the conference. The conference proceedings 
  will be published within Springer LNCS series. The submission page is
  http://www.easychair.org/SAT2009. Papers have to be submitted
  electronically as PDF files.
