	                Call for Papers

	         12th International Conference on
	Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing

	       June 20 - July 3, Swansea, Wales, UK

  The International Conference on Theory and Applications of
  Satisfiability Testing is the primary annual meeting for researchers
  studying the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT). SAT'09 is
  the twelth SAT conference. SAT'09 features the SAT competition, the
  QBF competition, the Pseudo-Boolean evaluation, and the MAX-SAT
  evaluation.


SCOPE 

  Many hard combinatorial problems can be encoded into SAT.
  Therefore improvements on heuristics on the practical, as well as
  theoretical insights into SAT apply to a large range of real-world
  problems. More specifically, many important practical verification
  problems can be rephrased as SAT problems. This applies to
  verification problems in hardware and software. Thus SAT is becoming
  one of the most important core technologies to verify secure and
  dependable systems. The topics of the conference span practical and
  theoretical research on SAT and its applications and include but are
  not limited to proof systems, proof complexity, search algorithms,
  heuristics, analysis of algorithms, hard instances, randomized
  formulae, problem encodings, industrial applications, solvers,
  simplifiers, tools, case studies and empirical results. SAT is
  interpreted in a rather broad sense: besides propositional
  satisfiability, it includes the domain of quantified boolean
  formulae (QBF), constraints programming techniques (CSP) for
  word-level problems and their propositional encoding and
  particularly satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). 


SUBMISSION

  Submissions should contain original material and can either be
  regular research papers up to 14 pages or short papers up to 6
  pages. Double submissions including submissions as short and long
  papers will be rejected.  Submissions should use the Springer
  LNCS style. All appendices, tables, figures and the bibliography
  must fit into the page limit. Submissions deviating from these
  requirements may be rejected without review. All accepted papers
  including short papers will be published in the proceedings of the
  conference. The conference proceedings will be published within
  Springer LNCS series. The submission page is
  http://www.easychair.org/SAT2009. Papers have to be submitted
  electronically as PDF files. Abstract submissions are due by
  February 20 and papers submissions by February 27.
